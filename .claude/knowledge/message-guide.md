## 6. Data Sources

### From APIs
- **Price, Volume** — Yahoo Finance (primary) or Twelve Data (fallback)
- **RSI, SMA21** — Twelve Data (when API key is set), otherwise calculated
- **52w high** — Twelve Data (fallback only)
- **News** — Finnhub

### Calculated Locally
- **RVOL** = today's volume ÷ 63-day SMA of volume
- **Price Change %** = (close − previous close) ÷ previous close × 100
- **SMA50, SMA200** = simple moving average of last 50/200 closes
- **52w high** = max of last 252 trading days
- **pctFromAth** = (price − ATH) ÷ ATH × 100
- **monthsInConsolidation** = trading days since last ATH touch ÷ 21
- **nearSMA21, nearAth, inConsolidationWindow** = comparisons vs thresholds above
- **Setup (🎯/👀)** = RVOL ≥ minRVOL + all three setup conditions
